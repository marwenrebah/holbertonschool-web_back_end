# :octocat: ES6 Basics

In this project, we have developed a series of JavaScript utility functions aimed at performing various tasks efficiently. These functions cover a range of functionalities, from manipulating strings and arrays to handling objects and generating descriptive texts. Let's delve into each function and understand its purpose and implementation.

## :rocket: Features:

- `taskFirst()`: Returns a string expressing a preference for using const whenever possible.
- `getLast()`: Returns a string indicating that something is okay.
- `taskNext()`: Constructs a string combining the preference expressed in taskFirst() with the statement from getLast().
- `taskBlock(trueOrFalse)`: Returns an array containing boolean values based on the input argument.
- `getNeighborhoodsList()`: Initializes an object with San Francisco neighborhoods and provides a method to add new neighborhoods.
- `getSumOfHoods(initialNumber, expansion1989, expansion2019)`: Calculates the sum of the initial number and two optional expansion values.
- `returnHowManyArguments(...args)`: Returns the number of arguments passed to the function.
- `concatArrays(array1, array2, string)`: Concatenates two arrays and a string into a single array.
- `getSanFranciscoDescription()`: Generates a descriptive text about the income, GDP, and GDP per capita of San Francisco in a specific year.
- `getBudgetObject(income, gdp, capita)`: Constructs an object representing budget data with income, GDP, and capita values.
- `getBudgetForCurrentYear(income, gdp, capita)`: Constructs an object representing budget data for the current year.
- `getFullBudgetObject(income, gdp, capita)`: Extends the budget object with methods to format income in dollars and euros.
- `appendToEachArrayValue(array, appendString)`: Appends a string to each value in an array.
- `createEmployeesObject(departmentName, employees)`: Constructs an object with department name as key and employees as value.
- `createReportObject(employeesList)`: Constructs a report object with all employees and a method to get the number of departments.

## :computer: Usage:

These utility functions can be imported into any JavaScript project to perform specific tasks efficiently. Simply import the desired function(s) and call them as needed within your code.
