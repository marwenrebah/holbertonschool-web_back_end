# Async Generator and Comprehension Project 🚀

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python using the asyncio library. It consists of three main parts:

- An asynchronous generator function that yields random numbers with a delay. 🔁
- An asynchronous comprehension that collects random numbers from the generator. 🌀
- A function to measure the runtime of the asynchronous comprehension. ⏱️

## Files
- `0-async_generator.py`: Contains the asynchronous generator function.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Contains the asynchronous comprehension function.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Contains the function to measure the runtime of the asynchronous comprehension.
