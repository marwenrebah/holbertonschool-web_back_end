# Async Generator and Comprehension Project

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous generators and comprehensions in Python using the `asyncio` library. It consists of three main parts:

1. An asynchronous generator function that yields random numbers with a delay.
2. An asynchronous comprehension that collects random numbers from the generator.
3. A function to measure the runtime of the asynchronous comprehension.

## Files

- `0-async_generator.py`: Contains the asynchronous generator function.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Contains the asynchronous comprehension function.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Contains the function to measure the runtime of the asynchronous comprehension.
