# Basic Annotations

This project demonstrates the use of basic annotations in Python. It consists of several functions and variables with type annotations.

## Files

- `0-add.py`: Contains the `add` function that takes two floating-point numbers and returns their sum as a float.
- `1-concat.py`: Contains the `concat` function that takes two strings and returns their concatenation.
- `2-floor.py`: Contains the `floor` function that takes a floating-point number and returns its floor as an integer.
- `3-to_str.py`: Contains the `to_str` function that takes a floating-point number and returns its string representation.
- `4-define_variables.py`: Contains the definitions of several variables with type annotations.
- `5-sum_list.py`: Contains the `sum_list` function that takes a list of floats and returns their sum as a float.
- `6-sum_mixed_list.py`: Contains the `sum_mixed_list` function that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
- `7-to_kv.py`: Contains the `to_kv` function that takes a string and an integer or float and returns a tuple containing the string and the square of the integer or float as a float.
- `8-multiplier.py`: Contains the `make_multiplier` and `multiplier_function` functions that create and apply a multiplier function.
- `9-element_length.py`: Contains the `element_length` function that takes an iterable of sequences and returns a list of tuples containing the elements and their lengths.
