# Python Async Comprehension, Function, and Variable Annotations üêç

This repository contains three projects demonstrating various features and practices in Python:

## **Python Async Comprehension** üåÄ

This project showcases the use of **asynchronous comprehensions** in Python using the asyncio library. It includes an asynchronous generator function, an asynchronous comprehension, and a function to measure the runtime of the comprehension.

### Files

- `0-async_generator.py`: Contains the asynchronous generator function.
- `1-async_comprehension.py`: Contains the asynchronous comprehension function.
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Contains the function to measure the runtime of the asynchronous comprehension.

## **Python Async Function** ‚öôÔ∏è

This project demonstrates the use of **asynchronous coroutines** in Python using the asyncio library. It includes several asynchronous functions that utilize asyncio to perform tasks asynchronously, such as waiting for random delays and measuring runtime.

### Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Contains the basic asynchronous coroutine.
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Contains the coroutine that waits for multiple random delays.
- `2-measure_time.py`: Contains the function that measures the runtime of the coroutine.
- `3-tasks.py`: Contains the function that creates asyncio tasks.

## **Python Variable Annotations** üî¢

This project illustrates the use of **type annotations** for variables and functions in Python. It includes several functions and variables annotated with type hints to indicate the expected types of inputs and outputs.

### Files

- `0-add.py`: Contains the `add` function that takes two floating-point numbers and returns their sum as a float.
- `1-concat.py`: Contains the `concat` function that takes two strings and returns their concatenation.
- `2-floor.py`: Contains the `floor` function that takes a floating-point number and returns its floor as an integer.
- `3-to_str.py`: Contains the `to_str` function that takes a floating-point number and returns its string representation.
- `4-define_variables.py`: Contains the definitions of several variables with type annotations.
- `5-sum_list.py`: Contains the `sum_list` function that takes a list of floats and returns their sum as a float.
- `6-sum_mixed_list.py`: Contains the `sum_mixed_list` function that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
- `7-to_kv.py`: Contains the `to_kv` function that takes a string and an integer or float and returns a tuple containing the string and the square of the integer or float as a float.
- `8-multiplier.py`: Contains the `make_multiplier` and `multiplier_function` functions that create and apply a multiplier function.
- `9-element_length.py`: Contains the `element_length` function that takes an iterable of sequences and returns a list of tuples containing the elements and their lengths.
