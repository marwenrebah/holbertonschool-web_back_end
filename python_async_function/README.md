# Async functions ⚙️

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous coroutines in Python using the `asyncio` library. It consists of four main parts:

1. A basic asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay. ⏳
2. A coroutine that waits for multiple random delays and returns a sorted list. 🔄
3. A function that measures the runtime of the coroutine. ⏱️
4. A function that creates asyncio tasks. 📝
